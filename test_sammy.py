        I'm using Brazilian coffee beans, but my brew is coming out too sour. 
        How can I fix this? I'm using a V60 pour-over method with a 1:16 ratio.
        Can you be very specific and give me few examples from the database of brews that are similar to mine but less sour?
        When sharing these examples please share the experiment id and when it was brewed.
